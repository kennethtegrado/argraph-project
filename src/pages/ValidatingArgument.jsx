                    The study of propositions and their logical connections is
                    the focus of propositional logic. Without taking into
                    account the precise content or meaning of those
                    propositions, it prioritizes investigating and altering the
                    logical structure of statements. Propositions are statements
                    that can only be true or false in propositional logic. They
                    are symbolized by variables, which are frequently identified
                    by letters like p, q, or r. The rules for deducing these
                    propositions' truth values are established by propositional
                    logic, which also permits the incorporation of these
                    propositions using logical operators. It enables the
                    analysis of logical connections between propositions as well
                    as the structured manipulation of logical expressions. One
                    can build strong arguments, assess logical consistency, and
                    reason formally and rigorously about complex systems by
                    using propositional logic.

                        Apply logical operators: To combine the propositions and
                        create compound propositions, use logical operators. The
                        commonly used logical operators are negation (~ or Â¬),
                        conjunction (â§ or &), disjunction (â¨ or â¥), conditional
                        (â), and biconditional (â).

                                    Negation: To represent the denial or
                                    negation of a proposition, use the negation
                                    operator. The negation of p, for instance,
                                    would be ~p.

                                    Conjunction: The logical "and" operation is
                                    represented by the conjunction operator. For
                                    instance, the compound proposition "p and q"
                                    is represented by pâ§q.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Disjunction: The logical "or" operation is
                                    represented by the disjunction operator. For
                                    instance, the compound proposition "p or q"
                                    is represented by pâ¨q.

                                    Conditional: To represent the conditional
                                    relationship, use the implication operator.
                                    For instance, the compound statement "if p,
                                    then q" is represented by pâq.
                                </li>

                                    Biconditional: The biconditional or
                                    equivalence relationship is represented by
                                    the equivalence operator. For instance, the
                                    compound proposition "p if and only if q" is
                                    represented by the symbol pâq.
                                </li>

                        Formulate arguments: Combine propositions and use
                        logical operators to build arguments. An argument is
                        made up of one or more premises (propositions
                        presumptively true) and a conclusion (the inferred or
                        claimed proposition). Example argument: Let's construct
                        an argument using our propositions and operators:
